Hi guys, this is the first resource of the team and the first release chosen is a standalone notification script. Below you will find the basic notifications present. You can add and remove notifications as you wish and everything will be written in the readme file of the resource including how to use them.

Many will wonder why the resource is called xNotify instead of being called Alph0xNotify, well it's called that because the team was thinking of doing more series on the store which are still to be defined together with the store.
